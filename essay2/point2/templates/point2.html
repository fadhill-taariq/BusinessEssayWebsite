      <h3 style="border-style: hidden; border-left: 6px solid rgb(189, 140, 49); background-color: rgba(189, 140, 49, 0.575);"><b>The Life of Spaulding</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>C.C Spaulding’s journey to the upper echelon of black excellence is unlike his peer Robert Church, Spaulding did not have tragedies presented to him, instead, he started by living a humble life with his free parents and thirteen siblings near Whiteville, North Carolina [13]. His success starts in a familiar background for many African Americans, allowing him to further cement himself as a goal for all to aspire to reach. Migrating to Durham in the mid-1890s [13] was the beginning of his entrepreneurial career, starting work and eventually directing the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company; holding this position until death [13]. </p>
       <p> This obituary of Spaulding (simply titled Charles Clinton Spaulding) was written by W M. Brewer in 1952 and goes on to coat Spaulding’s achievements as highly deserving. “The steady success and expansion of this enterprise have amazed thousands of people…Mr. Spaulding’s roots of business genius…”,[5] even post-mortem it is conveyed that citizens owe a great deal of respect to Spaulding as his efforts were well received by any who may have crossed paths with him. The Negro History Bulletin was published in Washington D.C., hundreds of miles from Spaulding’s residence in North Carolina, and initially began as a monthly newsletter for high school teachers, “with articles providing ideas for lessons on African American history.” [14]. This article of Spaulding goes on to show his massive impact on the education of the next generation, with his “The Administration of Big Business” [2] becoming a pillar for budding entrepreneurs looking to follow in his footsteps.</p>
       <p> Written in the accredited Pittsburgh Courier, “The Administration of Big Business” is one of Spaulding’s long-lasting contributions to the uplift of black business in America. This piece written by Spaulding goes on to claim that “The big business executive is worse off than the so-called wage slave.”, backing this up by describing that the executive oversees many families other than his own, while his employees may venture to other industries, the executive must stay and continue moving forward. This sets a grand idea of responsibility as how one acts is his fault, his successes and failures are due only to himself. </p>
       <p>Now venturing into educating the masses, we see that Spaulding’s contributions are not only from him expanding North Carolina Mutual to a multi-state empire with nearly 100,000 clients in 1908 [7] but now affecting other industries than his own as his piece is not limited to the entrepreneurship of a specific kind. In the space of 45 years, Spaulding lead North Carolina Mutual from having a total premium income of $1,585 to $6 million [6], a testament to Spaulding’s managerial genius. </p>
       <p>Many of Spaulding’s words and claims still apply today, proving that the ‘Father of African American Management’ [3] title is not undeserving, all who use this paper as a reference for self-improvement owe some of their success to Spaulding. While this is just one example of the teachings Spaulding generously publicised, it will remain one of (if not) his greatest contributions to black business for centuries to come.</p>
