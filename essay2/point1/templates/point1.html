      <h3 style="border-style: hidden; border-left: 6px solid rgb(189, 140, 49); background-color: rgba(189, 140, 49, 0.575);"><b>Black America Before Spaulding</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>To understand Spaulding’s success and how monumental it was for African Americans to see a man like him rise to unseen wealth; we must understand the world of black America before Spaulding. Before his birth, free and enslaved African Americans primarily started businesses in professions such as tobacconists, shoemakers, and barbers [8] as these professions required little start-up costs and can grow in popularity through word-of-mouth which continued to be African American’s most valuable form of promotion due to the small number of newspapers willing to advertise black-owned businesses. </p>
       <p> Emancipation greatly assisted these existing entrepreneurs as they could now work within the American legal structure. While better than nothing, this legal structure still actively worked against them and many opposers to this progress made it known that the newly freed African Americans were not accepted through public outcry, especially in the South. </p>
       <p> The Emancipation Proclamation was the start of a new era for black America, but it did not guarantee the safety or freedom it promised. “It also expressly exempted parts of the Confederacy…the freedom it promised depended upon Union military victory.” [9]. This indicates that the battle for equal opportunities and rights between white and black America was not something that could be easily waved or enforced. </p>
       <p>Among the previous successful African American entrepreneurs who Spaulding would join as pinnacles of black excellence, was Robert Reed Church. Church accrued his wealth with little aid from Emancipation, instead capitalizing on his city’s destruction during the yellow fever epidemic of 1878 [10]. Church is an example of how the opportunities of Emancipation can be quickly overshadowed by public disgust, with Church falling victim to the Memphis Race Riot of 1866 [10], where Church was attacked by a white mob of mostly policemen and left for dead despite his prominent presence in his community. Ida B. Wells, a journalist closely tied to Church, is a good indicator of the public opinion of Church’s wealth among the black community. Actively criticising him by stating “What benefit is a ‘leader’ if he does not devote his time, talent, and wealth to the alleviation of his people’s poverty and misery and to their elevation?” [11]. Through this we can see that before Spaulding’s time of grand philanthropy and a deep sense of gratitude for his community, the first African American millionaires were much less noble in their efforts to assist those lower than themselves; with Church as an example of someone who would go on to be more generous with his ample wealth later in his life after criticism from Ida B. Wells.</p>
       <p>In a 1912 article by the Pittsburgh Courier written post-mortem, the general opinion of the public is that many were curious about Church’s wealth, perhaps due to his sheer existence being a marvellous sight as a slave-born negro rising to millionaire status. “To the mastery of a fortune estimated at a million dollars made him a conspicuous character…his death was received all over the city with expressions of interest and surprise.” [12]. The average Memphis citizen was unaware of Church’s riches aside from his flashy park on Beale Avenue, which further indicates the wealthy black population pre-Spaulding’s hesitance towards philanthropy. This would work as a worthy comparison to Spaulding, who was frequently active in his community and gave much for the betterment of black America.</p>
