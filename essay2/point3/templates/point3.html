      <h3 style="border-style: hidden; border-left: 6px solid rgb(189, 140, 49); background-color: rgba(189, 140, 49, 0.575);"><b>Spaulding's Success and Legacy</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Empowerment is also an occurring feature of Spaulding’s writing; alongside responsibility, a man must rise above the stereotypes and assumptions made about him by society and prove that the colour of his skin will not be an excuse for failure and will not define his position as a businessman.</p>
       <p> Spaulding’s ‘Is the negro meeting the test in business?’ [4], written in 1933 is a piece received exactly as previously stated; as a black man your successes and failures are your own and the colour of your skin should not be a crutch to rely on or an excuse at the ready. “I am beginning more and more to resent such implications.” [4], Spaulding continues to state that responsibility is a trait every man regardless of their colour must master to be noticed and revered as a businessman. Now working in and directing North Carolina Mutual for around 30 years, Spaulding’s words were backed with ample experience and thus his thought pieces continue to be highly respected. Further, into the piece, Spaulding backs up the claim of responsibility by saying “He commits against his race a vile slander who attempts to differentiate between the inherent capabilities of white and black men for verily there are none.”, commenting that to hide behind his skin colour, a man devalues his successes and proves the point society has imposed on him, the black man cannot be on equal ground with the white man.</p>
       <p> As living proof as arguably one of America’s greatest executives [3], Spaulding holds the next generation accountable and refuses to allow them to limit themselves behind colour.</p>
       <p>The ‘golden age of black business’ [15] spanned from 1900 to 1930, when Spaulding remained a pillar of guidance, success, and generosity to his community. However, Spaulding’s legacy continues past his death, with his descendants being able to afford college tuition due to his success. “We try to help our young generation to continue on the legacy of the Spaulding family.” [16] Spaulding remains highly respected, with relatives as far down as his great nephew revering his generosity, “He actually gave my grandmother money to build a tobacco barn.”, this directly shows how long-lasting Spaulding’s legacy is, but does this success stretch past his own family?</p>
       <p>As with all African American entrepreneurs, Spaulding has a great amount of pride in his community and so did his best to give back in any way he could. Aside from his business leadership, Spaulding was also active in political issues and was a vocal advocate for many civil rights advancements. “As chairman of the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, he engaged in voter registration efforts and convinced city officials to hire black police officers.” [17], Spaulding took up many positions that allowed him to be part of these changes, including more employment for African Americans in all sectors. His impact as a businessman gave him this power, which was always used to lift his community members, with possibly his most generous act taking place during WWII, where Spaulding would sell war bonds to African Americans and even invest a large portion of North Carolina Mutual’s funds in the bonds. [18] It is an undisputed fact that Charles Clinton Spaulding was a pillar of aspiration and respect during and well after his time.</p>
